# NOT WORKING!!!

# TTGO-T-RaceTimer 

This is an attempt to make AlessandroAU/Chorus32-ESP32LapTimer (https://github.com/AlessandroAU/Chorus32-ESP32LapTimer) work on a 
TTGO T-Display and add/change some things.


## Things to do

- TTGO T-Display support
- Color TFT support
- Make solo pilot version (like original Chorus RF(https://github.com/voroshkov/Chorus-RF-Laptimer))
- Link multiple solo timers to do a multi pilot race
- Design PCB for solo linkable timer
